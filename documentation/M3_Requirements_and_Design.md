# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History
- 3.4 Non Functional Requirement: 2/22/2025
      - We previously mentioned that there must never be more than 10 pins on the map at any given time to avoid cluttering the map. However, removing pins from the map/limiting them will definitely make the app lose information and users would suffer from that loss of information. Therefore, we make it less restrictive where pins must not block other pins making them unclickable -- If they are too close together, cluster them into a single clickable pin. Using this clustering algorithm, we could obtain the original goal of avoiding cluttering the map while also preserving information for the users.

- 3.3 Functional Requirements (Recommendation): 3/1/2025
      - The recommendation was originally thought to be part of a filter, where user can opt to show or don't show the recommended posts on the map. However, we then realize the control is too cluttered if recommendation is in the filter. It would have a better separation of concern if there is a dedicated recommendation section that shows all recommended posts for the user, and this will be located in the Profile Page.
- 4.1 Main Components: 2/25/2025 
      - Previously, to obtain posts, there were only single /posts routes and this includes obtaining private and public posts. However, this is unsecure because users may exploit this by changing query param and obtain private posts of others. Therefore, we separate posts into /posts and /posts-authenticated where /posts is used by non-authenticated user and can only obtain public posts. On the other hand, /posts-authenticated can be used to obtain private posts but only the posts from the requesting user.

- 3.3 Functional Requirements (Chat): 3/2/2025 
      - To trigger chat, previously we named the button as "Chat", but we think it would be more descriptive to rename it as "Send Message".

- 4.1. Main Components: 3/1/2025 
      - The interfaces in each of the main components were changed to accurately reflect the names and functionalities present in the code we are now using as these are more in depth than those that were present before.
      - The purpose for the Recommendation component was changed to accurately reflect the methodology we are currently using to recommend locations.
- 4.2. Databases: 3/1/2025 
      - The MessageDB was added and the description for ChatDB to accurately reflect how we decided to store chatrooms and messages in seperate databases to make the databases more organized.
- 4.8. Main Project Complexity Design: 3/1/2025 22:29
      - The recommendation algorithm was changed in the documentation to reflect how it currently works in the code we are using, as this differs from the original algorithm we had in mind as we found that the current algorithm yields more relevant results. Previously our algorithm focused more on the distance between the locations of different posts and suggests location nearby to posts the requesting user has made in the past, however now we focus more on the similarity between users by way of post location similarity and prioritize suggesting locations that similar users have been to.
- 3.1. Use-Case Diagram: 3/1/2025 
      - We changed the diagram so that the Search Locations and Display Map no longer include Login User as we realized that users that have not yet been logged in should be able to access these functionalities.
- 3.3 - Functional Requirements (Display Map): 3/2/2025
      - Previously when user didn't grant the app location permission, the app would bring the view to Vancouver as default view. However, we changed this and set latitude longitude (0, 0) as the default view. This is because setting Vancouver as the default view seems like a very biased decision (especially if users are not based in Canada), hence we used (0, 0) which is the default location for a lot of location-based apps. 
- 3.4 Non Functional Requirements: 3/14/2025
      - Add security functional requirements - some features will be blocked without login
- 3.3 Functional Requirements: 3/14/2025
      - Delete failure scenario google map api is unavailable since this cannot be caught to handle failure. There is no exception, the google map returned from the function is not null, just blank when render.

## 2. Project Description
Our app allows people to keep a history of all the places they have traveled to and thus acts as a travel advisory forf others and a travel journal for themselves. Our target audience is young people who like to travel and take photos. Such users typically will have a large amount of photos compiled chronologically in a photo app i.e. Google Photos, but without much sense of where they were taken. As such, our solution involves viewing and navigating around a map with pins that show the user’s past images, as well as small optional notes that they can add. Furthermore, users can receive recommendations for future travel locations based on their travel history. When viewing other people's notes, they can optionally chat with the person taking a photo to ask about the logistics of traveling there (i.e. Do they accept cash? How much equipment did you bring?)

### **3.4. Non-Functional Requirements**
<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **Pins of other posts must not prevent other pins' clickablity**
    - **Description**:, If posts are close together and hard to click, they must be grouped into a single clickable pin.
    - **Justification**:  When multiple posts are close, it is natural that the pins will cover each other and would block other pins making them hard to click or worse not clickable at all. This must be resolved with clustering algorithm 
2. **At most 4 clicks to access any of the use cases**
    - **Description**: No more than 4 clicks are necessary to access any of the main use cases
    - **Justification**: This allows for the user to navigate the app easily and makes every use case within a comfortable reach from the user.
3. **Login is required for upload, delete posts, view profile and chat**
    - **Description**: Features such as upload, delete posts, view profile and chat require login before accessing these features. Trying to use these features without login will result in an alert saying that "Login is required to ...".
    - **Justification**: For security, we decide that users use this features without login because these features alter the data or view personal information such as chats, preferences. Moreover, for post deletion, we also need to know if the current user is the owner of the post

## 4. Designs Specification
### **4.1. Main Components**
1. **User**
    - **Purpose**: Manages user authentication and user data.
    - **Rationale**: Our backend may involve repetitive operations on querying User's database. This module provides a wrapper to the query and aligns with Dont Repeat Yourself principle.
    - **Interfaces**: 
        1. `public static bool signInWithGoogle(String token)`
            - **Purpose**: Verifies user's Google ID token. Returns true If user is successfully authenticated, otherwise returns false.
        2. `public static User getUser(String userID)`
            - **Purpose**: Wrapper for database query to get User information, given userID.
        3. `public static User createUser(User new_user)`
            - **Purpose**: Adds a new user the application and saves the user in the database.


2. **Post**
    - **Purpose**: Manages posts data and allows posts retrieval based on location range or user's map view.

    - **Interfaces**: 
        1. `public static String createPost(Post post)`
            - **Purpose**: creates and uploads a post where user explicitly provides the locations associated to the images. If isPrivate is True, the post is only visible to the user, otherwise it's visible to the public
        2. `public static bool updatePost(String postID, Post new_post)`
            - **Purpose**: edit a post.
        3. `public static bool deletePost(String postID)`

            - **Purpose**: retrieve all posts.

3. **Chat**
    - **Purpose**: Manages chat data and sends user a notification on new message.
    - **Rationale**: Chat is defined as its own component, as chat is a specific feature of our app. Separating this from User or Post component aligns with Single Responsibility Principle
    - **Interfaces**: 
        1. `public static ChatMessage addMessage(String chatroom_id, String sender, String message)`

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**
1. [**No more than 10 pins on the screen at any time**](#nfr1)
    - **Validation**: Both the suggestion algorithm and the user's own posts will be given in priority stacks based on on-screen proximity to each other, and hence the number of pins and how crowded they are can be managed.
2. [**At most 4 clicks to access any of the use cases**](#nfr2)
    - **Validation**: UI will be designed such that the central functionality of the app (i.e. the map) will have navigation to each use case so that it will not become cumbersome to use. The map will be the home page of the app, which already eliminates one click before most of the functionality.



### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
**Suggestion Algorithm**
- **Description**: The suggestion algorithm will suggest new locations with corresponding pins with pictures of those locations appearing on the map, if the suggestion feature is enabled.
- **Why complex?**: The algorithm contains nested loops and specialized calls to the database that had to be designed specifically for this suggestion algorithm.
- **Design**:
    - **Input**: Requesting user's id, number of locations to suggest
    - **Output**: A list of pins corresponding to recommended locations
    - **Main computational logic**: The suggestion algorithm pick locations to suggest based off of the post of other users and how similar those users posts were to the requesting user's posts. The most popular locations amongst the most similar users will be then suggested to the user.
    - **Pseudo-code**: 
        ```
        FUNCTION get_recommendations(user_id, num_locations):
            // Step 1: Get User Post Locations
            user_post_locations = GET_USER_POST_LOCATIONS_FROM_ID(user_id)

            // Step 2: Get similar users
            similar_users = []
            FOR location IN user_post_locations:
                similar_user_list = GET_USER_IDS_WITH_POSTS_AT_LOCATION(location)
                APPEND similar_user_list TO similar_users

            // Step 3: Get most similar users
            most_similar_users = []
            FOR 1 to 3:
                most_similar = GET_MODE(similar_users)
                REMOVE ALL most_similar FROM similar_user
                APPEND most_similar TO most_similar_users

            // Step 4: Get most popular locations amongst the most similar users
            similar_locations = []
            FOR user IN most_similar_users:
                APPEND GET_USER_POST_LOCATIONS_FROM_ID(user) TO similar_locations
        
            REMOVE ALL user_post_locations FROM similar_locations

            // Step 5: Sort and return top suggestions
            ranked_locations = SORT_BY_MODE(similar_locations)
            top_suggestions = ranked_locations.TAKE(num_locations)  // Take top suggestions
            RETURN top_suggestions

        FUNCTION GET_USER_POST_LOCATIONS_FROM_ID(user_id):
            // Gets all the locations of the posts with the given user_id from the database
            RETURN user_post_locations

        FUNCTION GET_USER_IDS_WITH_POSTS_AT_LOCATION(location):
            // Gets all the user ids with posts at the given location from the database
            RETURN user_ids

        FUNCTION GET_MODE(array):
            // Retrieves the value that appears the most in the array
            RETURN most_popular

        FUNCTION SORT_BY_MODE(array):
            // Sorts the array in descending order based on how many times they appear in the array
            sorted_array = []
            WHILE array IS NOT EMPTY:
                most_popular = GET_MODE(array)
                REMOVE ALL most_popular FROM array
                APPEND most_popular TO sorted_array
            RETURN sorted_array
        
        ```
